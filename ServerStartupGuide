Server Startup

The server can be started in ACTIVE or PASSIVE mode by setting the property in device.invalidationStrategy

ACTIVE: Devices are invalidated by their own timer task, invalidation should happen strictly
        along the specified time in device.staleDeviceTimeinSec.

PASSIVE: Devices are invalidated by a separate service.
         So, device.staleDeviceTimeinSec indicates devices will be invalidated anytime after the device.staleDeviceTimeinSec
         this is another strategy, this can be enhanced to throttle down staleness cycle.

start scripts for unix and linux are located in \scripts or after the build can in found in the /bin dir of the zip file.
